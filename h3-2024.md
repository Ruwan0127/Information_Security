# OWASP: OWASP 10 2021

## A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration
- Ninety percent of applications ran misconfiguration tests.
- More than 208k CWE cases were discovered.
-Lack of security hardeninng, turning on pointless features, utilizing default accounts, disclosing private information, or having unsafe configurations make something vulnerable.

### Preventive actions:
- Put safe installation procedures in place.
- Make sure the platform is simple and devoid of extra features.
- Review and update setups on a regular basis.
- Put in place a divided application architecture.
- Forward clients' security instructions.
- For verification, use automated procedures.

### A Focus on Prevention:
- Give secure installation first priority for similar configurations.
- Reduce the platform's size to improve security.
- Review and update setups on a regular basis.
- To effectively separate, use segmentation.
- Follow clients' security instructions.
- Automate the configuration verification process.

This emphasizes how crucial it is to have ongoing security monitoring and proactive security controls in place to stop security misconfigurations in application environments.


## A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- Vulnerable Components Management handles difficulties in testing and analyzing dangers associated to components, ranking #2 in community surveys and data analysis. 
- The category uses a default exploits/impact weight of 5.0 and does not have any mappings of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).
- CWE-1104: Utilization of Unmaintained Third-Party Components and two of the Top 10 from 2013 and 2017 are important CWEs.

- Organizations are vulnerable if they don't know which versions of components to use, if they use unsupported or obsolete software, if they don't run frequent vulnerability scans, if they don't upgrade or patch platforms quickly, and if they don't test new libraries for compatibility.
- Misconfigured security measures may increase the risk.

### Strategies for Prevention:
- Put in place a reliable patch managemnt procedure.
- Eliminate any unnecessary parts and functions.
- Keep an eye on and inventory the dependencies and versions of the components constantly.
- Learn about vulnerabilities by consulting resources such as CVE and NVD.
- Purchase parts only from reputable, secure vendors; sealed packages are preferred.
- Take care of problems with out-of-date or poorly maintained libraries; think about virtual patching.
- Create a continuous monitoring, prioritizing, and updating plan.
  
This emphasizes how crucial it is to have a thorough plan that includes proactive steps and ongoing monitoring in order to manage susceptible components in an application's lifespan.

  
## A03:2021 – Injection
- The paper focuses on application injection vulnerabilities, including External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73), SQL Injection (CWE-89), and Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79).
- Important details consist of:

### occurrence:
- Third in terms of prevalence, injections impact 94% of applications that have been assessed.
- The average occurrence rate is 3%, with a maximum of 19%.
- There were 274,000 injection cases found overall.

### Causes of Vulnerability:
Vulnerabilities are caused by the direct usage of dynamic queries and the absence of validation for data submitted by users.
Risks include direct query concatention with hostile data and ORM search parameters.

### Typical Types of Injections:
Injections from SQL, NoSQL, OS commands, ORM, LDAP, and EL/OGNL are frequently used.

### Preventive actions:
- Make use of parameterized interfaces, secure APIs, or switch to ORM tools.
- Implement server-side input validation that is positive, but be mindful of its limitations.
- For dynamic queries, use particular syntax and character escaping.
- To stop the publication of large amounts of data, use SQL controls like LIMIT.

### Tools and Testing:
- Reviewing the source code is essential for detection.
- Vulnerabilities are found in the CI/CD process with the aid of automated testing tools (SAST, DAST, and IAST).

### Emphasis on Prevention:
- Distinguish data from searches and actions.
- Select ORM tools, parameterization, and secure APIs.
- Use several strategies to ensure successful prevention.
  
The study emphasizes how crucial it is to have a thorough plan in place to stop injection vulnerabilities, one that incorporates a range of precautions and testing methods for strong application security.
