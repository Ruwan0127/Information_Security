# Don't mind the air gap - Maximizing exfiltration speeds via HDMI TEMPEST - windytan

The research project "HDMI Tempest" which looked into the possibilities of using HDMI cables' accidental radio emissions to convey data, was covered in the presentation. 

## HDMI Tempest: 
- The study found that the weak radio signals that the HDMI cable emits can leak information that is presented on a screen. 
- In the event that an adversary manages to intercept and decode these signals, there could be a security concern.

## Optimizing Exfiltration Speeds: 
- The scientist created a technique that allows data to be encoded in these radio emissions and sent at up to 1 megabit per second.
- This implies that these emissions may allow sensitive data to be stolen from a system.

## Limitations and issues: 
- Although the technology achieves reasonably high transmission speeds, there are a number of limitations and issues associated with it. 
- It is not practical for transmitting huge files, suffers from data loss, and necessitates control over the content presented on the screen.
- It can also be interfered with by other radio frequencies that are in the surrounding area.

## Mitigations: 
- Possible solutions to address this vulnerability were covered in the presentation.
- The use of scrambling algorithms in HDMI 2.0 and later versions considerably reduces unintentional radio transmissions.
- Using insulated HDMI cables may also provide security against listening in on these transmissions.

## Ethical Considerations: 
- It is realized that the researcher did not offer guidance on how to take advantage of this vulnerability.
- The study aimed to increase public knowledge of the possible security concerns connected to HDMI connections and to promote the implementation of mitigation techniques.
- Unauthorized use of security vulnerabilities for profit is against the law and unethical.
