# Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains
   ## Eric M. Hutchins∗, Michael J. Cloppert†, Rohan M. Amin, Ph.D.‡Lockheed Martin Corporation

### Intrusion Kill Chain: 

- A kill chain is a systematic process to target and engage an adversary to create desired effects.
- This paper present new kill chain model for intrusion
- Is defined as reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control (C2), and actions on objectives


### Courses of Action: 

- For defenders, Courses of Action function similarly to a game plan. 
- They are calculated reactions to prevent cyberattacks. To prevent attacks, defenders employ strategies such as spotting, rejecting, interfering, weakening, tricking, and eliminating.
- For instance, they may employ tools to identify the threat, prevent access, obstruct communication, or deceive the attackers during an attack.
- By taking these steps, defenders can gauge and strengthen their capacity to avoid cyberattacks.
