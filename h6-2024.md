# TOR Browser


## 7 Key Points About Tor:

1. Effective, but not foolproof:
   Tor protects against common attacks but requires proper usage and isn't completely anonymous if both ends of the connection are monitored.

2. Used for various reasons:
   Beyond criminal activity, Tor is used by activistis, journalists, and others for privacy protection and secure communication.
   
3. No military backdoor:
   Despite initial funding, Tor has no backdoor and is open-source for transparency.
   
4. Running relays likely legal:
   No legal issues documented in the US for running Tor relays, but engaging in illegal activities while using Tor can cause problems.
   
5. Easy to use:
   User-friendly options like the Tor Browser Bundle and Tails OS simplify Tor access.
   
6. Improving speed:
   While slower than regular connections, Tor's speed is constantly improving, and contributing relays helps further.
   
7. Be mindful of limitations:
   Using Tor incorrectly or logging into tracked services within Tor can compromise anonymity.


## The implications of Tor for forensic analysis:


- Widespread anonymity is made possible by Tor:
  The abstract highlights how virtually everyone may connect online anonymously with Tor, regardless of technical proficiency.

- Tor hides users but is not stealthy:
  It makes clear that the goal of Tor is to make user identification and monitoring very difficult, if not impossible, rather than to completely conceal internet usage.

- Overcoming Tor's anonymization is difficult:
  The introduction highlights Tor's efficacy and implies that attempts to overtly undermine its anonymization typically fail.

- Pay attention to forensic evidence rather than dialogue:
  Although it may be difficult to access internet communication directly over Tor, the abstract indicates that important forensic evidence can still be located in the form of forensic artifacts, the traces left by Tor use on a device.
